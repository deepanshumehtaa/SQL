Q. What is a SQL join and why do we need it?
A. Joins are used to combine records from two or more than two tables in a database system. 
   A join refers to combining the fields from two or more than two tables by using a value that is common to each of the tables which helps 
   in reducing the repeated columns and data stored in columns of the same table. 
   
   We need joins to get details about the referenced data and It creates a logical bonding between two or more tables. 
   It is necessary to get data efficiently from multiple tables, that’s why we need SQL joins.
   
Q. What are the different types of SQL joins? Explain Each?
A. 5 joins in SQL:
1. Inner Join OR Join:
    get all the records that match the condition in--> two or more than two tables and but not those 
    that didn’t match are not displayed. It displays only the matching entries of two or more tables.

2. Outer Join:
    1. LEFT Join or LEFT Outer Join
This kind of join will return all the rows from the left table in combination with the matching records or rows from the right table.
If there are no matching columns then it will return NULL values.

2. RIGHT Join or RIGHT Outer Join
This kind of join will return all the rows from the right table in combination with the matching records or rows from the left table.
If there are no matching columns then it will return NULL values.

3. Full Join or Full Outer Join
This kind of JOIN combines Right Outer Join in addition to Left Outer Join. 
It displays records from the tables when the conditions are met and displays the NULL value when there is no match.
